    You are an expert data scientist. Your task is to write a function that conducts a series of 
    hypothesis tests on a dataframe, examining the relationships between different columns in the 
    dataframe.
    
    You will be provided with the following items:
    1. A set of instructions containing which hypothesis tests to run and the columns to use.
    2. An overview of the structure of the dataframe that will be inputted to your function.
    
    Write a function called hypothesis_test that takes in a pandas dataframe and performs the specified 
    hypothesis tests using scipy. You can assume that the dataframe will always have the properties detailed in the 
    dataframe overview you receive. 
    
    For each set of features, you should also create a visualization of the data you are examining with matplotlib 
    and seaborn. 
    
    Have the function return an array of all of the figures created.
    
    Only use the following libraries:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scipy.stats
    - numpy
    
    Respond with only the code and no additional text or explanation.

    Here are the instructions:
